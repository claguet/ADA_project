				Swiss politics are steered by regular federal votations that take place several times a year. As a swiss
				citizen, it might be difficult to keep track of the many results of votations and be aware of how deep
				economic, social and cultural differences may lead to considerable geographical differences in the votation
				tendencies. In this context, we explored the relationship between cantonal characteristics and votation
				outcomes and developed a tool to interactively visualize them. 17 social, economic and demographic features
				were found to significantly correlate with votation outcomes. Out of these, six were selected for display
				in a map where the orientation of the results of votations (right/left) can be optionally overlayed for
				several votation categories, including  economy, health, immigration and more. Overall, this tool allows
				to intuitively identify the factors affecting swiss votation outcomes, and gain insights about swiss society.
